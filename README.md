# Hangman Game

Welcome to the Hangman game! Hangman is a word-guessing game where players attempt to guess a hidden word by suggesting letters within a certain number of guesses. Each incorrect guess results in part of a gallows being drawn. If the gallows is completed before the word is guessed, the player loses.

## How to Play

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
3. The game will start automatically.
4. You will see a series of blank spaces representing the hidden word and a gallows with an empty hangman figure.
5. Guess letters by clicking on the buttons provided or by typing them on your keyboard.
6. If the guessed letter is part of the word, it will be revealed in the appropriate blank space(s). If not, a part of the hangman figure will be drawn.
7. Keep guessing letters until you either guess the word correctly or the hangman figure is completed.
8. If you want to play again, simply refresh the page.
