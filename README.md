# Hangman Game

Welcome to the Hangman game! Hangman is a word-guessing game where players attempt to guess a hidden word by suggesting letters within a certain number of guesses. Each incorrect guess results in part of a gallows being drawn. If the gallows is completed before the word is guessed, the player loses.

## How to Play

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
3. The game will start automatically.

5. Guess letters by clicking on the buttons provided or by typing them on your keyboard.
